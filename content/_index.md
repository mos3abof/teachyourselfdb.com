# Teach Yourself Database Systems

A raw draft roadmap to diving deep into database systems. This is a work in progress, and is subject to a lot of
changes.

## Foundational Concepts

- Start with understanding the basic principles of database management systems (DBMS)
- Learn about data models: relational, document, key-value, graph, and columnar models
- Study fundamental database design concepts, including normalization and data integrity

## Relational Databases Deep Dive

- Master SQL in depth (advanced querying, window functions, complex joins)
- Study relational algebra and relational calculus
- Learn about B-tree and indexing strategies
- Learn about LSM trees
- Understand ACID properties and transaction management
- Explore query optimization techniques

## Database Design

- Learn entity-relationship (ER) modeling
- Practice database schema design
- Study normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Understand denormalization and when to apply it

## Advanced Database Concepts

- Distributed database systems
- Sharding and horizontal scaling
- Replication and consistency models
- CAP theorem
- NoSQL databases and their use cases
- NewSQL and hybrid database approaches

## Performance and Optimization

- Query performance tuning
- Indexing strategies
- Caching mechanisms
- Database benchmarking
- Understanding execution plans
- Profiling and optimization techniques

## Practical Implementation

Choose 2-3 database systems to deeply learn

- PostgreSQL (for advanced relational features)
- MySQL / MariaDB
- MongoDB (for document databases)
- Cassandra (for wide-column stores)
- Redis (for key-value stores)

## Emerging Technologies

Learn about:

- Time-series databases
- Graph databases
- In-memory databases
- Blockchain databases
- Machine learning-integrated databases

## Recommended Learning Resources

### Books:

- "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann
- "Database System Concepts" by Silberschatz, Korth, and Sudarshan
- "Principles of Database Systems" by Ullman and Widom

### Online Courses:

- Stanford's Database course on Coursera
- Carnegie Mellon's Advanced Database Systems course
- MIT's Database Systems course on edX

## Hands-on Practice

- Build personal projects
- Contribute to open-source database projects
- Set up your own database infrastructure
- Practice with cloud database services (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL)
- Simulate real-world scenarios and scalability challenges

## Continuous Learning

- Follow database conferences and research papers
- Join database-focused communities (Reddit's r/database, Stack Overflow)
- Attend webinars and tech talks
- Keep up with emerging database technologies and research

## Recommended Learning Sequence:

1. Start with foundational concepts
2. Deep dive into relational databases
3. Learn SQL thoroughly
4. Study database design principles
5. Explore advanced concepts
6. Implement practical projects
7. Learn performance optimization
8. Experiment with different database systems

## Pro Tips:

- Don't just read theory—implement everything
- Build projects that challenge your understanding
- Experiment with different database systems
- Learn about database internals and how they actually work
- Understand trade-offs between different database technologies
- This roadmap provides a structured approach to mastering database systems. Adjust the pace and depth according to your
learning style and existing knowledge.
- The key is consistent practice and hands-on implementation.
